## How to Add a Token

If you want to add a new token to the list, follow these steps:

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**  
   Fork the repository then Clone it to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HyperSwapX/hyperswap-token-list.git
   cd hyperswap-token-list
   ```
2. Modify the `tokens.json` File
   Open the `tokens.json` file in a text editor and add your token's information. Make sure to follow the existing format in the file.
   
   Here is the Token object model you must use to add your token to the list:
   ```typescript
   interface Token {
     name: string;           // Name of the token
     decimals: number;       // Number of decimals for the token
     symbol: string;         // Symbol of the token
     address: string;        // Contract address on the blockchain
     chainId: number;        // Chain ID where the token is deployed
     logoURI: string;        // URL of the token's logo image
     tags: string[];         // Tags associated with the token
   }
   ```
   ℹ️ Note: You can add the `websiteUrl`, `telegramUrl`, and `discordUrl` attributes, which are optional but will provide additional information about your project or token.

   The logo must meet the following criteria:
   - Size: 125x125
   - Please upload your image on the PR (any link will not be accepted).

   Here is an example with USDC token
   ```json
   
      {
            "name": "USD Circle",
            "decimals": 6,
            "symbol": "USDC",
            "address": "0x....",
            "chainId": 998,
            "logoURI": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6319/standard/usdc.png",
            "tags": [
                "tokenv1"
            ]
        },
     
   ```

4. Submit a Pull Request
   After adding your token, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository. Then, create a pull request to the main branch of the `hyperswap-token-list` repository.
   ```bash
   git add tokens.json
   git commit -m "chore: add [Your Token Name] to tokens list"
   git push origin main
   ```
   Go to the repository on GitHub and click on "New Pull Request" to submit your changes.

## Pull Request Review

All pull requests will be reviewed and processed to ensure they follow the required format and standards. Once approved, your token will be added to the list on the DApp, making it available for users to interact with.

By adding your token to this list, it will be registered on the HyperSwap exchange, and its logo will be displayed alongside other tokens, enhancing its visibility.

We appreciate your contributions!
